# Quark - the editor the world doesn't need

Quark is an editor written in Haskell that started as a learning project with
the aim to replace nano with something similarly simple and clean, but somewhat
more powerful. It is slightly inspired by [Atom](https://atom.io), hence the
name (in other words quark as in the elementary particle, not the dairy
product), as well as a few other editors and IDEs.

Quark is still in it's infancy, but should work in all xterm-256color
environments as well as most rxvt-unicode-256 environments (albeit with a few
more quirks). Any and all bug reports for these environments are welcome, as
are suggestions for UI improvements or added functionality.
