# Quark - the editor the world doesn't need

Quark is an editor written in Haskell as a learning project by an author that wanted something more useful than nano, but did not want to invest the time needed to learn emacs or vim (preferring to use fully fledged IDEs for large projects anyway). It is slightly inspired by [Atom](https://atom.io), hence the name (in other words quark as in the elementary particle, not the dairy product), as well as a few other editors and IDEs.

It currently satisfies most of the author's everyday needs as a lightweight terminal editor and should work in all xterm-256color environments. There are a few kinks and quirks and, unfortunately, the source code is the documentation for now. Feel free to try it out, contribute, report bugs and/or request functionality.
